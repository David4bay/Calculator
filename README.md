# What I learned
I learnt a lot about JavaScript DOM scripting.

# Future additions
I'd like to implement a separate screen hovering at the side to save the answers up to a certain limit. Also hope to create a variant that uses jQuery for it's logic.

# Inspiration
The Calculator design is inspired from the calculator I once used for my WAEC/NECO exams in Secondary School.
